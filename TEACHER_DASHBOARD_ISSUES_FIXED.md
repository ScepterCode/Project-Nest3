# Teacher Dashboard Issues Fixed

## Summary
Fixed 9 critical issues with the teacher dashboard to improve functionality and user experience.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Class Code Generation and Display
**Problem**: When a class was created, teacher didn't get a code
**Solution**: 
- Fixed class code generation using the existing `ClassCodeGenerator`
- Added prominent display of class code after creation
- Added copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Class codes are now properly formatted for display (e.g., "MATH 101A")

### 2. ✅ Class Creation Notifications
**Problem**: No notification when class was created
**Solution**:
- Fixed notification API endpoint (was using `/api/notifications`, now uses `/api/notifications/create`)
- Added proper notification creation after successful class creation
- Notifications include class name, code, and action buttons

### 3. ✅ Dashboard Button Functionality
**Problem**: Buttons on the dashboard were not functional, only navbar buttons worked
**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned teacher dashboard with functional buttons
- Added hover effects and proper navigation
- Buttons now properly route to:
  - My Classes
  - Create Class
  - Assignments
  - Analytics
  - Rubrics
  - Peer Reviews

### 4. ✅ Class Creation Form Performance
**Problem**: Each letter typed caused page reload, making typing slow
**Solution**:
- Removed unnecessary `e.preventDefault()` calls from input handlers
- Optimized form validation to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Form now responds smoothly to user input

### 5. ✅ Persistent Onboarding Message
**Problem**: "Onboarding Complete!" message appeared permanently on dashboard
**Solution**:
- Modified onboarding completion logic to show message briefly (5 seconds) after completion
- Added session storage flag to track when onboarding was just completed
- Message now auto-dismisses and doesn't reappear on subsequent visits

### 6. ✅ Manage Class Page (404 Error)
**Problem**: Manage class button gave 404 error due to missing page
**Solution**:
- Created complete `app/dashboard/teacher/classes/[id]/manage/page.tsx`
- Fixed `useParams` import and usage
- Added comprehensive class management interface with:
  - Class overview with statistics
  - Student enrollment management
  - Class settings
  - Copy class code functionality

### 7. ✅ View Details Button
**Problem**: View details button on class cards was not working
**Solution**:
- Created `app/dashboard/teacher/classes/[id]/page.tsx` for class details
- Added comprehensive class details view with:
  - Class information cards
  - Quick action buttons
  - Navigation to manage, assignments, and analytics

### 8. ✅ useParams Runtime Error
**Problem**: `useParams is not defined` error in manage class page
**Solution**:
- Fixed import statement for `useParams` from Next.js navigation
- Added proper error handling for missing parameters
- Added loading states and error boundaries

### 9. ✅ Missing Import Error
**Problem**: `useOnboardingCompletion` hook not imported in onboarding reminder
**Solution**:
- Added missing import: `import { useOnboardingCompletion } from '@/lib/hooks/useOnboardingCompletion'`
- Fixed all related import dependencies

## Technical Improvements
