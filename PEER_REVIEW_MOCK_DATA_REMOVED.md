- status (draft/active/completed/cancelled)
- reviews_per_student (Integer)
- start_date, end_date (Timestamps)
- instructions, rubric (JSONB)
```

### **peer_reviews**
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- peer_review_assignment_id (UUID, FK)
- reviewer_id (UUID, FK to users)
- reviewee_id (UUID, FK to users)
- submission_id (UUID, FK to submissions)
- status (pending/in_progress/completed/flagged)

- Activity logs are properly scoped to relevant users

### **Data Validation**
- Rating constraints (1-5 scale)
- Status enums for consistency
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicate reviews

## 📈 **Real-Time Features**

### **Teacher Dashboard**
- Live assignment statistics
- Real completion progress tracking
- Activity feed with actual timestamps
- Quality metrics from real review data
- Flagged content monitoring

### **Student Dashboard**
