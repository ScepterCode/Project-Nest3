# Enrollment Error Fix

## Current Issue
Getting "Enrollment error: {}" when trying to join a class. The class lookup now works, but enrollment insertion fails.

## Root Cause
The `enrollments` table either:
1. Doesn't exist
2. Has restrictive RLS policies blocking student insertions
3. Missing proper foreign key constraints

## Complete Fix

### Step 1: Run the Complete Enrollment Fix
Execute `fix-enrollment-complete.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor. This will:
- ✅ Create the `enrollments` table if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Add proper foreign key constraints
- ✅ Set up comprehensive RLS policies
- ✅ Create indexes for performance
- ✅ Add trigger to update enrollment counts

### Step 2: Verify the Setup
Run `test-enrollment-access.sql` to verify:
- Table exists and has correct structure
- RLS policies are properly configured
- Foreign key constraints are in place

### Step 3: Test the Flow
1. Go to `/dashboard/student/classes/join`
2. Enter a valid class code
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Should now successfully enroll

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Console Output (Success):
```
Looking for class with code: DESI2451
✅ Found class: DesignDESI
Class details: {id: "...", name: "DesignDESI", status: "active", ...}
Checking existing enrollment...
✅ No existing enrollment found
Creating enrollment record...
✅ Successfully enrolled! Enrollment ID: ...
```

### Console Output (If Still Failing):
The improved error logging will show specific issues:
- "Enrollments table does not exist" → Run the SQL fix
- "Permission denied" → RLS policy issue
- "Duplicate key" → Already enrolled
- "Foreign key" → Invalid references

## Database Schema Created

### Enrollments Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.enrollments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    class_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES classes(id),
    student_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'enrolled',
    enrolled_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(class_id, student_id)
);
```

### RLS Policies:
- Students can view/create/update their own enrollments
- Teachers can view/manage enrollments in their classes
- Proper authentication checks

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test enrollment table access
node test-enrollments-table.js

# Test complete class join flow
node test-class-join-flow.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting Empty Error Objects:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify you're logged in as a student (not teacher)
3. Ensure the class code is correct and active
4. Run the SQL verification queries

### If Permission Denied:
1. Check RLS policies are created correctly
2. Verify user authentication
3. Ensure student_id matches auth.uid()

### If Foreign Key Errors:
1. Verify class exists and ID is correct
2. Check user ID is valid
3. Ensure foreign key constraints are properly set up

The fix should resolve the enrollment insertion issue and provide clear error messages for any remaining problems.
