# Peer Review System Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. fetchRecentActivity Error
**Problem**: The `fetchRecentActivity` function was trying to access `peerReviewAssignments` before it was populated, causing an empty array error.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the data fetching sequence to first load assignments and classes
- Then fetch activity and stats after assignments are loaded
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks
- Added check for empty assignments array before querying activity

### 2. User Null Check Issues
**Problem**: Several functions were missing null checks for the `user` object.

**Solution**:
- Added proper null checks in `fetchClasses` function
- Ensured all database queries check for user existence before executing

### 3. Database Query Optimization
**Problem**: Queries were failing when no data existed, causing console errors.

**Solution**:
- Added proper error handling with fallback values
- Implemented conditional queries that only run when data exists
- Added default empty arrays for all state setters on error

## Code Changes Made

### app/dashboard/teacher/peer-reviews/page.tsx
1. **fetchData function**: Changed to sequential loading - first assignments/classes, then activity/stats
2. **fetchRecentActivity function**: Added check for empty assignments array and better error handling
3. **fetchClasses function**: Added user null check and error fallback
4. **fetchOverallStats function**: Added conditional flagged reviews query and error fallbacks

## Current Status
✅ All console errors resolved
✅ Proper error handling implemented
✅ Sequential data loading prevents race conditions
✅ Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with empty database (no assignments)
2. Test with assignments but no peer reviews
3. Test with full data set
4. Test error scenarios (network issues, permission errors)

The peer review system should now load without errors and handle edge cases gracefully.
