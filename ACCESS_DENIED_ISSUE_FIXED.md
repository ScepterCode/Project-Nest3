# Access Denied Issue Fixed

## Problem
Users with the "teacher" role were getting "Access Denied" errors when trying to access teacher dashboard features, even though they had the correct role in the database.

## Root Cause
The `AuthStatusChecker` component was using the old authentication metadata (`user.user_metadata?.role`) instead of the database role to check permissions. This caused a mismatch because:

1. The system was updated to use database roles for security
2. Some components were still checking the old auth metadata
3. The auth metadata might not be in sync with the database role

## Files Fixed

### 1. `components/auth-status-checker.tsx`
**Before:**
```typescript
const userRole = user.user_metadata?.role || 'student';
if (!allowedRoles.includes(userRole)) {
  // Show access denied error
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use RoleGate component for proper database-based role checking
return (
  <RoleGate userId={user.id} allowedRoles={allowedRoles}>
    {children}
  </RoleGate>
);
```

### 2. `app/dashboard/institution/page.tsx`
**Before:**
```typescript
if (!user || user.user_metadata?.role !== 'institution') {
  return <div>Access Denied</div>
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
return (
  <RoleGate userId={user.id} allowedRoles={['institution_admin']}>
    {/* page content */}
  </RoleGate>
);
```

## How the Fix Works

1. **Database-First Approach**: Now uses `RoleGate` component which queries the database for the user's actual role
2. **Consistent Role Checking**: All role checks now use the same database-based method
3. **Proper Error Handling**: The `RoleGate` component handles loading states and database errors gracefully

## Impact
- Teachers can now access teacher dashboard features without getting "Access Denied" errors
- Role checking is now consistent across the application
- Better security through database-based role verification
- Improved error handling for role-related issues

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Log in as a teacher
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/teacher/classes`
3. Should now see the classes page instead of "Access Denied"
4. All teacher navigation items should be accessible

## Related Components
The following components now work together for proper role checking:
- `RoleGate` - Database-based role verification
- `AuthStatusChecker` - Authentication and role wrapper
- `useUserRole` - Hook for getting database roles
- `permission-gate` - Permission-based access control
