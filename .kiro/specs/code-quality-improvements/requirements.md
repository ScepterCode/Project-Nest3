# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Code Quality Improvements feature addresses the TypeScript and ESLint violations currently present in the codebase. This spec focuses on resolving unused variables, explicit any types, and other code quality issues to maintain a clean, maintainable, and error-free codebase that follows best practices and coding standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused variables and imports to be removed from the codebase, so that the code is clean and doesn't contain dead code that could confuse future maintainers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running ESLint THEN the system SHALL not report any `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` errors
2. WHEN variables are defined but not used THEN they SHALL be removed from the codebase
3. WHEN imports are defined but not used THEN they SHALL be removed from import statements
4. WHEN function parameters are not used THEN they SHALL be prefixed with underscore or removed if possible
5. WHEN destructured variables are not used THEN they SHALL be replaced with appropriate patterns or removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all explicit `any` types to be replaced with proper TypeScript types, so that the codebase maintains type safety and prevents runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running ESLint THEN the system SHALL not report any `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` errors
2. WHEN `any` types are used THEN they SHALL be replaced with specific interface definitions or union types
3. WHEN function parameters use `any` THEN they SHALL be typed with appropriate interfaces or generic types
4. WHEN return types are `any` THEN they SHALL be explicitly typed with the correct return type
5. WHEN object properties are `any` THEN they SHALL be typed with proper interface definitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all database query results to be properly typed, so that database operations are type-safe and prevent runtime errors from incorrect data access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying the database THEN all query results SHALL be typed with appropriate interfaces
2. WHEN using Supabase client THEN query results SHALL use generated types or custom interfaces
3. WHEN handling database errors THEN error objects SHALL be properly typed
4. WHEN processing query data THEN data transformations SHALL maintain type safety
5. WHEN returning database results THEN return types SHALL match the expected data structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service layer functions to have proper error handling and type definitions, so that the application is robust and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service functions are called THEN they SHALL have proper try-catch blocks where appropriate
2. WHEN service functions return data THEN they SHALL have explicit return type annotations
3. WHEN service functions handle errors THEN they SHALL use typed error objects
4. WHEN service functions accept parameters THEN all parameters SHALL be properly typed
5. WHEN service functions use external APIs THEN responses SHALL be typed with appropriate interfaces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all utility functions and middleware to follow consistent coding patterns, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions are defined THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript type annotations
2. WHEN middleware functions are used THEN they SHALL follow Next.js middleware patterns with proper typing
3. WHEN helper functions process data THEN they SHALL use appropriate type guards and validation
4. WHEN constants are defined THEN they SHALL use `const` assertions where appropriate
5. WHEN configuration objects are used THEN they SHALL be typed with proper interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React components to follow TypeScript best practices, so that the UI layer is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React components are defined THEN they SHALL have proper prop type definitions
2. WHEN component state is used THEN state variables SHALL be properly typed
3. WHEN event handlers are defined THEN they SHALL use appropriate event type annotations
4. WHEN hooks are used THEN they SHALL have proper type parameters where needed
5. WHEN component refs are used THEN they SHALL be typed with appropriate element types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to enforce code quality standards, so that code quality issues are caught early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL run ESLint and TypeScript checks
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL fail if there are TypeScript or ESLint errors
3. WHEN pull requests are created THEN CI/CD SHALL validate code quality standards
4. WHEN code quality issues are found THEN they SHALL be reported with clear error messages
5. WHEN code passes quality checks THEN the build SHALL proceed successfully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive type definitions for all external dependencies, so that third-party integrations are type-safe and well-documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using external libraries THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions installed
2. WHEN external API responses are processed THEN they SHALL be typed with custom interfaces
3. WHEN third-party components are used THEN they SHALL have proper prop type definitions
4. WHEN external configuration is used THEN it SHALL be typed with appropriate schemas
5. WHEN integrating with external services THEN request/response types SHALL be properly defined
