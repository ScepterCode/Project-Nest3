- ✅ `app/dashboard/teacher/analytics/grades/page.tsx` - Grade analytics page

## Navigation Links Removed

### Peer Reviews Page

## What Remains

The application now has:
- ✅ Teacher dashboard with classes, assignments, rubrics, and peer reviews
- ✅ Institution admin dashboard with users and departments management
- ✅ Student dashboard functionality
- ✅ All core functionality intact without analytics/reports

## Result

- **No Analytics Pages**: All analytics functionality has been completely removed
- **No Reports Pages**: All reporting functionality has been completely removed  
- **No Navigation Links**: No broken links or references to removed features
- **Clean Codebase**: No orphaned components or unused analytics-related code
- **No Demo Data Issues**: Since the features are gone, there are no demo data problems

The application is now streamlined without any analytics or reporting capabilities, focusing purely on the core educational platform features (classes, assignments, rubrics, peer reviews, user management).

## Next Steps

1. Restart the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Verify that all analytics and reports links are gone from navigation
3. Confirm that the application works normally without these features
4. The PowerShell error you encountered was likely due to npm not being in the PATH - you can start the dev server manually or restart your terminal

The analytics and reports features have been completely torn down as requested.
