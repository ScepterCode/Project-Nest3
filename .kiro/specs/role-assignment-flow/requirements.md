# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Role Assignment Flow feature will manage how users are assigned roles within the educational platform, including initial role assignment, role verification, role changes, and permission management. This addresses the current gap where role assignment is unclear and there's no systematic way to manage role transitions or verify role authenticity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want my role to be properly validated and assigned based on my institutional affiliation, so that I have appropriate access to platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a role during onboarding THEN the system SHALL require verification based on role type
2. WHEN a user claims to be a teacher THEN the system SHALL require institutional email verification or admin approval
3. WHEN a user claims to be an admin THEN the system SHALL require existing admin approval or institutional domain verification
4. IF a user cannot verify their role THEN the system SHALL assign a pending status until verification is complete
5. WHEN role verification is complete THEN the system SHALL activate the user's account with appropriate permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an institution administrator, I want to approve or deny role requests from users claiming to be teachers or admins, so that I can maintain control over who has elevated permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests teacher or admin role THEN the system SHALL notify relevant institution administrators
2. WHEN an admin views pending role requests THEN the system SHALL display user information and requested role
3. WHEN an admin approves a role request THEN the system SHALL immediately grant the role and notify the user
4. WHEN an admin denies a role request THEN the system SHALL provide reason options and notify the user
5. WHEN a role request is pending for more than 7 days THEN the system SHALL send reminder notifications to admins

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to request a role change when my position changes, so that my platform access matches my current responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to change roles THEN the system SHALL provide a role change request form
2. WHEN a role change is requested THEN the system SHALL require justification and supporting information
3. WHEN a role change affects permissions THEN the system SHALL require appropriate approval workflow
4. IF a user requests a role downgrade THEN the system SHALL allow immediate processing with confirmation
5. WHEN a role change is approved THEN the system SHALL update permissions and notify the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to bulk assign roles to users based on institutional data imports, so that I can efficiently onboard large groups of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin uploads a user data file THEN the system SHALL validate the format and required fields
2. WHEN processing bulk role assignments THEN the system SHALL validate each user's role against institutional rules
3. WHEN bulk assignment encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports with line numbers
4. WHEN bulk assignment is successful THEN the system SHALL send welcome emails to new users with their assigned roles
5. IF bulk assignment partially fails THEN the system SHALL process successful entries and report failed ones

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand what permissions my role provides, so that I know what features I can access and what actions I can perform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL display their current role and associated permissions
2. WHEN a user's role changes THEN the system SHALL show a comparison of old vs new permissions
3. WHEN a user accesses a restricted feature THEN the system SHALL explain what role is required for access
4. WHEN displaying permissions THEN the system SHALL use clear, non-technical language
5. WHEN a user has multiple roles THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the combined permission set

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a department administrator, I want to manage roles for users within my department, so that I can control access without involving institution-level administrators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a department admin views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL show users within their department
2. WHEN a department admin assigns roles THEN the system SHALL restrict assignments to department-appropriate roles
3. WHEN a department admin modifies user roles THEN the system SHALL log the changes for audit purposes
4. IF a role change affects institution-level permissions THEN the system SHALL require institution admin approval
5. WHEN department boundaries change THEN the system SHALL handle role reassignments appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to audit role assignments and changes, so that I can ensure proper access control and detect unauthorized privilege escalation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any role change occurs THEN the system SHALL log the change with timestamp, actor, and reason
2. WHEN an admin views audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by user, role, date range, and action type
3. WHEN suspicious role changes are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for review
4. WHEN generating audit reports THEN the system SHALL include role distribution statistics and change trends
5. WHEN exporting audit data THEN the system SHALL ensure data privacy compliance and access controls

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with temporary elevated permissions, I want my role to automatically revert after a specified period, so that I don't retain unnecessary access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning temporary roles THEN the system SHALL require an expiration date
2. WHEN a temporary role expires THEN the system SHALL automatically revert to the previous role
3. WHEN a temporary role is about to expire THEN the system SHALL notify the user and relevant administrators
4. IF a temporary role needs extension THEN the system SHALL require new approval through the standard workflow
5. WHEN temporary roles are active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the temporary status and expiration date
