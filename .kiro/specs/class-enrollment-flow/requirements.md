# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Class Enrollment Flow feature will manage how students discover and join classes, how teachers manage class rosters and enrollment processes, and how institutions control class access and capacity. This addresses the current gap where class joining is limited to simple code entry without proper enrollment management, capacity controls, or approval workflows.
