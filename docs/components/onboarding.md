## Context and State Management

### OnboardingContext
Provides centralized state management for the onboarding flow.

**Context Value:**
```typescript
interface OnboardingContextType {
  currentStep: number;
  totalSteps: number;
  onboardingData: OnboardingData;
  updateOnboardingData: (data: Partial<OnboardingData>) => void;
  nextStep: () => void;
  previousStep: () => void;
  skipStep: () => void;
  completeOnboarding: () => Promise<void>;
  loading: boolean;
}
```

**OnboardingData Interface:**
```typescript
interface OnboardingData {
  userId: string;
  role: UserRole;
  institutionId?: string;
  departmentId?: string;
  classIds?: string[];
  skippedSteps: string[];
  currentStep: number;
  completedAt?: Date;
}
```

## Hooks

### useOnboarding
Main hook for accessing onboarding context.

```typescript
const {
  currentStep,
  totalSteps,
  onboardingData,
  nextStep,
  previousStep,
  skipStep,
  completeOnboarding
} = useOnboarding();
```

### useRoleSelection
Hook for role selection functionality.

```typescript
const {
  selectRole,
  validating,
  error
} = useRoleSelection();
```

### useInstitutionSearch
Hook for institution search and selection.

```typescript
const {
  institutions,
  loading,
  error,
  searchInstitutions,
  selectInstitution,
  clearSearch
} = useInstitutionSearch();
```

### useClassJoin
Hook for student class joining functionality.

```typescript
const {
  joinClass,
  loading,
  error
} = useClassJoin();
```
