# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Onboarding Flow feature will guide new users through the initial setup process after account creation, ensuring they understand their role, connect to the appropriate institution/department, and are ready to use the platform effectively. This flow addresses the current gap where users sign up but have no clear path to becoming productive platform users.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes email verification THEN the system SHALL redirect them to a role selection page
2. WHEN a user selects their role (student, teacher, institution admin, department admin) THEN the system SHALL save this role to their profile
3. IF a user tries to access the dashboard without completing role selection THEN the system SHALL redirect them back to the onboarding flow
4. WHEN a user completes role selection THEN the system SHALL proceed to the next onboarding step

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to connect to my institution and department during onboarding, so that I can access relevant classes and content.

6. IF a user is an institution admin THEN the system SHALL allow them to create a new institution during onboarding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new teacher, I want to understand how to create my first class during onboarding, so that I can start using the platform immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher completes institution/department selection THEN the system SHALL offer a guided class creation walkthrough
2. WHEN a teacher chooses to create a class THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance with tooltips and examples

4. IF a teacher skips class creation THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to this feature later from their dashboard

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new student, I want to join my first class during onboarding, so that I can immediately see relevant assignments and content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student completes institution/department selection THEN the system SHALL show options to join classes
2. WHEN a student enters a class code THEN the system SHALL validate and join them to the class if valid
3. WHEN a student successfully joins a class THEN the system SHALL show them a preview of the class dashboard
4. IF a student doesn't have a class code THEN the system SHALL explain how to get one from their teacher

### Requirement 5

2. WHEN the welcome screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show role-specific next steps and key features
3. WHEN a user clicks "Get Started" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their appropriate dashboard
4. WHEN a user completes onboarding THEN the system SHALL mark their onboarding as complete to prevent re-triggering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to skip optional onboarding steps and complete them later, so that I'm not forced through a lengthy process if I'm in a hurry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any onboarding step THEN the system SHALL provide a "Skip for now" option for non-essential steps
2. WHEN a user skips a step THEN the system SHALL save their progress and allow them to continue later
3. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard with incomplete onboarding THEN the system SHALL show gentle reminders to complete remaining steps
4. WHEN a user wants to complete skipped steps THEN the system SHALL provide easy access from their profile or dashboard

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to track onboarding completion rates and identify where users drop off, so that I can improve the onboarding experience.

3. WHEN users abandon onboarding THEN the system SHALL record the exit point for analysis
