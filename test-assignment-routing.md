# Assignment Routing Test

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Student assignment submission was showing pop-ups instead of full submission page
- **Root Cause**: Conflicting route files with different parameter names (`[assignmentId]` vs `[id]`)
- **Solution**: Removed old conflicting route and created proper assignment detail page

## Current Route Structure
```
app/dashboard/student/assignments/
├── page.tsx                    # Main assignments list
├── [id]/
│   ├── page.tsx               # Assignment detail page (NEW)
│   └── submit/
│       └── page.tsx           # Full submission page
└── simple/
    └── page.tsx               # Simple assignments view
```

## Fixed Routes
1. **Assignment List**: `/dashboard/student/assignments`
   - Shows all assignments with "Submit Assignment" buttons
   - Buttons link to `/dashboard/student/assignments/[id]/submit`

2. **Assignment Detail**: `/dashboard/student/assignments/[id]`
   - Shows assignment details and submission status
   - Has "Submit Assignment" button linking to submit page

3. **Assignment Submission**: `/dashboard/student/assignments/[id]/submit`
   - Full submission page with text/file/link options
   - No more pop-ups or alerts

## Test Steps
1. Go to `/dashboard/student/assignments`
2. Click "Submit Assignment" on any assignment
3. Should navigate to full submission page (not pop-up)
4. Try submitting with different types (text, file, link)
5. Verify status updates properly

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ **No pop-ups**: All interactions use full pages
- ✅ **Proper navigation**: Buttons link to correct routes
- ✅ **Status updates**: Submission status reflects in UI
- ✅ **Teacher visibility**: Teachers can see submissions

The routing conflict has been resolved and the submission system should now work properly.
