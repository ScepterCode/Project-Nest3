- Comprehensive status history

### 6. API Endpoints
**Files:** 
- `app/api/roles/verification/request/route.ts` - Submit and retrieve verification requests
- `app/api/roles/verification/review/route.ts` - Review and process verification requests
- `app/api/roles/verification/status/route.ts` - Track verification status and manage requests

### 7. Integration Tests
**File:** `__tests__/integration/role-verification-workflow-simple.test.js`
- Comprehensive test coverage for verification workflow
- Validation logic testing
- API response structure validation
- Error handling verification
- 17 test cases covering all major functionality
