# Onboarding and User Addressing Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Role Selection Interface Removed from Onboarding ✅

**Problem**: Users were seeing a role selection interface during onboarding even though roles were already set during registration.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `app/onboarding/page.tsx` to automatically detect user role from registration data
- Removed role selection step and go directly to role-specific onboarding
- Updated onboarding components to remove `onBack` prop and role selection functionality
- Added proper role detection from both database and user metadata

**Changes Made**:
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`: Removed role selection interface, added automatic role detection
- `components/onboarding/student-onboarding.tsx`: Removed back button to role selection
- `components/onboarding/teacher-onboarding.tsx`: Removed back button to role selection  
- `components/onboarding/institution-admin-onboarding.tsx`: Removed back button to role selection

### 2. User Addressing by Last Name ✅

**Problem**: Users were being addressed by their email addresses instead of their proper names (specifically last names).

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `contexts/auth-context.tsx` to include user profile data with names
- Added `getUserDisplayName()` function that prioritizes last name, then first name, then email
- Updated all dashboard pages to use proper user names instead of email addresses
- Updated onboarding welcome messages to use first names

**Changes Made**:
- `contexts/auth-context.tsx`: 
  - Added `UserProfile` interface and `userProfile` state
  - Added `getUserDisplayName()` function with proper name hierarchy
  - Enhanced user data loading to include names from database and metadata
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`: Updated to use `getUserDisplayName()`
- `app/dashboard/student/page.tsx`: Updated to use `getUserDisplayName()`
- `app/dashboard/teacher/page.tsx`: Updated to use `getUserDisplayName()`
- All onboarding components: Updated welcome messages to use first names

## User Display Name Priority

The system now follows this hierarchy for addressing users:

1. **Last Name** (preferred for formal addressing)
2. **First Name** (fallback if no last name)
3. **Email username** (fallback if no names available)

Example: "Abram Cole" will be addressed as "Cole" in most contexts.

## Technical Implementation

### Role Detection Flow
1. Check database `users` table for role
2. Fallback to user metadata from registration
3. Map 'institution' role to 'institution_admin' for consistency
4. Show appropriate role-specific onboarding

### Name Resolution Flow
1. Check `userProfile.last_name` from database
2. Check `userProfile.first_name` from database
3. Check `user.user_metadata.last_name` from registration
4. Check `user.user_metadata.first_name` from registration
5. Fallback to email username

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Role Detection**: 
   - Register with different roles (student, teacher, institution)
   - Verify onboarding skips role selection and goes to appropriate flow

2. **Test Name Display**:
   - Register with first and last names
   - Verify dashboards show last name in welcome messages
   - Test fallback behavior with missing name data

3. **Test Onboarding Flow**:
   - Verify no "Back to Role Selection" buttons appear
   - Verify welcome messages use first names appropriately
   - Test onboarding completion and dashboard redirection

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Removed role selection, added role detection
- `contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Enhanced with user profile and name resolution

### Onboarding Components
- `components/onboarding/student-onboarding.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/teacher-onboarding.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/institution-admin-onboarding.tsx`

### Dashboard Pages
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/student/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/teacher/page.tsx`

## Impact

- **User Experience**: More professional and personalized addressing
- **Onboarding Flow**: Streamlined process without redundant role selection
- **Consistency**: Proper name usage throughout the application
- **Accessibility**: Better user identification and personalization

Both issues have been resolved and the system now provides a more professional and streamlined user experience.
