# Institution Dashboard Navigation Fixed

## Problem
All buttons on the institution admin dashboard (Users, Departments, Reports) were opening the same page because the Reports page didn't exist, causing routing issues.

## Root Cause
The institution dashboard had three buttons linking to:
- `/dashboard/institution/users` ‚úÖ (existed)
- `/dashboard/institution/departments` ‚úÖ (existed) 
- `/dashboard/institution/reports` ‚ùå (missing)

When the reports page didn't exist, Next.js routing was likely falling back to a default page or causing navigation issues.

## Solution
Created a comprehensive Reports page at `app/dashboard/institution/reports/page.tsx` with:

5. **Report Controls** - Filters for report type and time period
6. **Export Functionality** - Demo export button with feedback

2. **Professional Interface** - Comprehensive reports dashboard
3. **Demo Functionality** - Fully functional in demo mode
4. **Consistent Experience** - Matches other institution pages
5. **Future-Ready** - Easy to connect to real data when database is set up

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Go to `/dashboard/institution` - main dashboard
2. Click "Go to User Management" - should open users page
3. Click "Go to Department Management" - should open departments page  
4. Click "Go to Activity & Reports" - should now open reports page
5. Each page should be distinct and functional

## What Each Page Now Shows:
- **Main Dashboard** - Overview cards with navigation buttons
- **Users Page** - User management with invitation functionality
- **Departments Page** - Department creation and user assignment
- **Reports Page** - Analytics, charts, and activity reports

The institution admin dashboard now has three fully functional, distinct pages that provide a comprehensive administrative experience.
