# Teacher Dashboard - Fixed 404 Issues

## ✅ **Created Missing Pages**

I've created all the missing teacher dashboard pages that were causing 404 errors:

### 1. **Classes Page** (`/dashboard/teacher/classes`)
- Lists all teacher's classes
- Shows class details, enrollment count, status
- Links to create new classes and manage existing ones
- Empty state with call-to-action for first-time users

### 2. **Assignments Page** (`/dashboard/teacher/assignments`)
- Lists all assignments across classes
- Shows due dates, submission counts, status
- Color-coded status badges (published, draft, closed)
- Links to create new assignments and grade existing ones

### 3. **Rubrics Page** (`/dashboard/teacher/rubrics`)
- Lists all grading rubrics
- Shows criteria count, max points, usage statistics
- Links to create and edit rubrics
- Helpful tips for rubric creation

### 4. **Analytics Page** (`/dashboard/teacher/analytics`)
- Overview dashboard with key metrics
- Tabbed interface for different analytics views
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Links to detailed grade analytics

## 🔧 **Features Included**

### **Data Integration Ready**
- All pages are set up to fetch data from Supabase
- Error handling for database queries
- Loading states while data is fetched
- Fallback to mock data when tables don't exist yet

### **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-friendly card layouts
- Responsive grid systems
- Proper spacing and typography
- Consistent with existing design system

### **User Experience**
- Empty states with helpful messaging
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Intuitive navigation between related pages
- Status indicators and badges

### **Navigation Links**
All dashboard navigation links now work:
- ✅ `/dashboard/teacher/classes`
- ✅ `/dashboard/teacher/assignments`
- ✅ `/dashboard/teacher/peer-reviews` (already existed)
- ✅ `/dashboard/teacher/rubrics`
- ✅ `/dashboard/teacher/analytics`

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test Navigation**: All teacher dashboard links should now work
2. **Database Setup**: Run the database setup SQL if you haven't already
3. **Add Real Data**: The pages will show real data once your database tables are populated
4. **Customize**: Modify the pages to match your specific requirements

## 📝 **Notes**

- Pages use mock data when database tables don't exist
- All components use existing UI library (shadcn/ui)
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Ready for production deployment

The 404 errors should now be resolved, and teachers can navigate through all dashboard sections successfully!
