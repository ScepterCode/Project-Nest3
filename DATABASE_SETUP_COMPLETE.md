# Complete Database Setup Instructions

## Current Status
Your application is connected to Supabase, but you're getting errors because some tables are missing. Here's how to complete the setup:

## 🚀 **Step 1: Run the Additional Table Creation Script**

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Open SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the contents of `create-classes-assignments-tables.sql`**
4. **Click "Run"**

This will create:
- ✅ **classes table** - For teacher classes
- ✅ **assignments table** - For class assignments  
- ✅ **RLS policies** - Proper security rules
- ✅ **Indexes** - For better performance

## 📊 **What This Fixes**

### **Before (Errors):**
```
Error fetching assignments: {}
Error fetching classes: {}
```

### **After (Working):**
- Teachers can create and view their classes
- Teachers can create and manage assignments
- All data persists in your Supabase database
- Proper security with Row Level Security

## 🎯 **Updated Features**

### **Teacher Dashboard:**
- **Create Classes** - Now saves to real database
- **View Classes** - Shows actual classes from database
- **Manage Assignments** - Real assignment management
- **Class Management** - Full CRUD operations

### **Institution Dashboard:**
- **User Management** - Real user invitations via Supabase Auth
- **Department Management** - Create and manage real departments
- **Reports** - Ready for real data (currently shows empty state)

## 🔧 **Database Schema Created**

### **Tables:**
1. **users** - User profiles and roles ✅
2. **institutions** - Organization management ✅  
3. **departments** - Department structure ✅
4. **classes** - Teacher classes ✅ (new)
5. **assignments** - Class assignments ✅ (new)

### **Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Teachers can only see/edit their own classes and assignments
- Users can only see their own profiles
- Proper foreign key relationships

## 🎉 **After Running the Script**

1. **Restart your application** (optional but recommended)
2. **Create a class** as a teacher - it will save to the database
3. **Create assignments** for your classes
4. **Invite users** as an institution admin
5. **No more console errors!**

## 📝 **Next Steps**

Once the tables are created, you can:
- Create real classes that persist
- Add assignments to your classes
- Invite real users to your institution
- Use all features with actual database storage

## 🔍 **Verification**

After running the script, you can verify it worked by:
1. Going to teacher dashboard → classes (should show empty state, not errors)
2. Creating a new class (should save successfully)
3. Checking the console (no more database errors)

Your application will be fully functional with persistent data storage!
