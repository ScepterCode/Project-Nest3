# Console Errors Fixed & Notification System Implemented

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Student Grades Page Console Error
**Problem:** `Error loading grades: {}` due to incorrect Supabase query structure

**Solution:**
- Fixed nested query structure in `app/dashboard/student/grades/page.tsx`
- Removed incorrect `!inner` joins that were causing query failures
- Added proper null checks and error handling
- Simplified the query to use standard joins instead of complex nested structures

### 2. Student Assignments Page Console Error  
**Problem:** `Error loading assignments: {}` due to similar query structure issues

**Solution:**
- Restructured the query in `app/dashboard/student/assignments/page.tsx`
- Split the query into two parts: first get enrollments, then get assignments
- Fixed property access issues with nested objects
- Added proper error handling and loading states
