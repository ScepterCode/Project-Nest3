# Student Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Student Pages (404 Errors) ✅

**Problem**: The Grades page and Assignments page on the student dashboard were giving 404 errors because the main pages didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created the missing main pages for student dashboard functionality.

**Files Created**:
- `app/dashboard/student/assignments/page.tsx` - Main assignments page for students
- `app/dashboard/student/grades/page.tsx` - Main grades page for students  
- `app/dashboard/student/classes/page.tsx` - Main classes page for students

### 2. Non-Functional Classes Button ✅

**Problem**: The classes button on the student dashboard wasn't functional and didn't navigate to a classes page.

**Solution**: 
- Created a comprehensive classes page that shows enrolled classes
- Made all dashboard buttons functional with proper navigation
- Updated the student dashboard to use clickable buttons instead of static divs

**Changes Made**:
- `app/dashboard/student/page.tsx`: Updated dashboard cards to be functional buttons with navigation
