# Single Role System Implemented

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Removed Role Switching**
- **Removed**: Role switcher component from dashboard header
- **Added**: Simple role display showing current role (non-clickable)
- **Result**: Users can see their role but cannot change it

### **2. Enforced Database-Only Role Detection**
- **Updated**: `useUserRole` hook to require database role (no fallback to metadata)
- **Updated**: Permission checker to deny access if database unavailable
- **Result**: All permissions now require valid database role

### **3. Enhanced Onboarding Protection**
- **Added**: Check for existing role during onboarding
- **Added**: Prevention of role changes after onboarding completion
- **Result**: Roles can only be set once during initial onboarding

### **4. Added Role-Based Dashboard Enforcement**
- **Updated**: Middleware to redirect users to their correct dashboard
- **Added**: Prevention of accessing wrong role dashboards
- **Result**: Teachers can only access teacher dashboard, students only student dashboard

### **5. Improved Error Handling**
- **Added**: Clear error messages when database role unavailable
- **Added**: Guidance to debug page for role issues
- **Result**: Users get clear feedback about role problems

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Registration/Onboarding Flow:**
1. User signs up and goes to onboarding
2. User selects their role (student/teacher/admin)
3. Role is permanently set in database
4. User is redirected to their role-specific dashboard
5. Role cannot be changed through UI afterward

### **Login Flow:**
1. User logs in
2. System fetches role from database (required)
3. User is redirected to their role-specific dashboard
4. Navigation shows only features for their role

### **Permission Checking:**
1. All permission checks require database role
2. No fallback to auth metadata
3. Access denied if database unavailable
4. Clear error messages for role issues

## 🔒 **Security Improvements**

### **Before (Problematic):**
- Users could switch between roles freely
- Fallback to auth metadata if database unavailable
- Multiple "profiles" for same user
- Inconsistent permission checking

### **After (Secure):**
- One fixed role per user
- Database role required for all access
- No role switching through UI
- Consistent permission enforcement

## 📝 **User Experience**

### **For Teachers:**
- Role set to "teacher" during onboarding
- Always redirected to `/dashboard/teacher`
- Can only access teacher features
- Cannot access student dashboard

### **For Students:**
- Role set to "student" during onboarding  
- Always redirected to `/dashboard/student`
- Can only access student features
- Cannot access teacher dashboard

### **For Admins:**
- Role changes require database-level access
- Clear audit trail of role changes
- No accidental role switching

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Database Role Enforcement:**
```typescript
// OLD (Insecure)
const userRole = user.user_metadata?.role || 'student'

// NEW (Secure)
const { roleData, error } = useUserRole()
if (!roleData) {
  // Show error, require database role
  return <RoleAccessRequired />
}
const userRole = roleData.role
```

### **Middleware Protection:**
```typescript
// Redirect users to their correct dashboard
if (userRole === 'teacher' && !currentPath.startsWith('/dashboard/teacher')) {
  redirect('/dashboard/teacher')
}
```

### **Onboarding Protection:**
```typescript
// Prevent role changes after onboarding
if (existingUser?.onboarding_completed) {
  alert('Role already set and cannot be changed')
  return
}
```

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior**

### **New Users:**
1. Sign up → Onboarding → Select role → Role permanently set
2. Future logins → Automatic redirect to role dashboard

### **Existing Users:**
1. Login → System checks database role
2. Redirect to appropriate dashboard
3. Access only features for their role

### **Role Issues:**
1. Database unavailable → Clear error message
2. No role in database → Redirect to debug/setup
3. Wrong dashboard access → Automatic redirect

The system now enforces one role per user with proper security and clear user experience!
