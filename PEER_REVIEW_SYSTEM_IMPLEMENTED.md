## Database Schema

The system uses three main tables:

### 1. `peer_review_assignments`
- Stores peer review assignment configurations
- Links to assignments and classes
- Contains settings and instructions

### 2. `peer_reviews`
- Individual review records
- Links reviewer to reviewee
- Stores ratings, feedback, and status

### 3. `peer_review_activity`
- Activity logging for analytics
- Tracks submissions, flags, completions

## Key Features

### Review Types
- **Anonymous**: Reviewers are hidden from reviewees
- **Named**: Reviewers are visible to reviewees
- **Blind**: Authors are hidden from reviewers

### Auto-Assignment
- Automatically assigns students to review each other's work
- Configurable number of reviews per student
- Prevents self-review (unless enabled)
- Random assignment algorithm

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time completion statistics
- Individual student progress
- Time spent tracking
- Quality metrics

### Feedback System
- Structured feedback with strengths and improvements
- Overall comments
- Numerical ratings
- Helpfulness ratings for received reviews

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `app/dashboard/teacher/assignments/[id]/peer-review/page.tsx` - Create peer review
2. `app/dashboard/teacher/peer-reviews/[id]/page.tsx` - Manage peer review results
3. `app/dashboard/student/peer-reviews/[assignmentId]/review/[reviewId]/page.tsx` - Student review interface
4. `components/ui/radio-group.tsx` - Radio group component
5. `peer-review-schema.sql` - Database schema (already existed)

### Modified Files
1. `app/dashboard/teacher/assignments/page.tsx` - Added "Create Peer Review" button
2. `app/dashboard/teacher/peer-reviews/page.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript issues
3. `app/dashboard/student/peer-reviews/page.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript issues

## Usage Instructions

### For Teachers

## Technical Notes

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- Teachers can only see their own assignments
- Students can only see their assigned reviews
- Proper user authentication required

### Performance
- Indexed database queries
- Efficient data fetching with joins
- Pagination ready (can be added)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Email Notifications**: Notify students of new reviews
2. **Rubric Integration**: Use existing rubric system for structured feedback
3. **Plagiarism Detection**: Flag similar reviews
4. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed reporting
5. **Bulk Operations**: Assign/manage multiple reviews at once
6. **Review Templates**: Pre-defined feedback templates
7. **Peer Review Calibration**: Training reviews for students

## Database Setup

Make sure to run the `peer-review-schema.sql` file in your Supabase SQL editor to create the necessary tables and policies.

The system is now fully functional and ready for use!
